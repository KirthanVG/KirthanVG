Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm KirthanVG, currently holding a diploma in Computer Engineering and an undergraduate student in Computer Science.

## ðŸš€ About Me
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Kirthan, a perpetual learner with an insatiable curiosity for knowledge. Whether it's delving into business strategies or exploring the depths of history, I'm always eager to expand my horizons. When I'm not absorbed in learning, you'll likely find me with my face in a novel, training my fitness and martial arts, or immersing myself in the world of coding.

As a computer engineer, my interests extend beyond traditional software development. I've ventured into the realms of cybersecurity and robotics, leveraging my skills to tackle challenges in these exciting fields. Whether it's programming code or building solutions, I'm passionate about leveraging technology to make a positive impact.
